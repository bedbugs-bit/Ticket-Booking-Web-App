# Ticket Booking System

This is a ticket booking system built with Laravel and React.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. The Laravel backend located in the root directory.
2. The React frontend located in the `ticket-react-app` directory.

### Laravel Backend

The Laravel application follows the standard Laravel project structure:

-   `app/` contains the core code of your application.
-   `config/` contains all of your application's configuration files.
-   `database/` contains your database migrations, model factories, and seeds.
-   `public/` contains the front controller and your assets (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.).
-   `resources/` contains your views, raw assets (LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript), and "language" files.
-   `routes/` contains all of the route definitions for your application.
-   `storage/` contains compiled Blade templates, file based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.
-   `tests/` contains your automated tests.

### React Frontend

The React application is bootstrapped with Vite and follows a standard React project structure:

-   `src/` contains the React components for your application.
-   `index.html` is the main HTML file that includes the root div where your React app is injected.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install PHP dependencies: `composer install`.
3. Install JavaScript dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` and update the environment variables to match your local environment.
5. Generate an application key: `php artisan key:generate`.
6. Run the database migrations: `php artisan migrate`.
7. Start the Laravel server: `php artisan serve`.
8. Navigate to the `ticket-react-app` directory and install the dependencies:
   `npm install`.
   9.Start the React development server: `npm run dev`.

## Building

To build the Laravel application, simply run `composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev`.

To build the React application, navigate to the `ticket-react-app` directory and run `npm run build`.

## Testing

To run the Laravel tests, use the `php artisan test` command.

To run the React tests, navigate to the `ticket-react-app` directory and run `npm run test`.

## Routes for the React App

The application includes the following routes:

-   `/` - The home page of the application.
-   `/admin/dashboard` - The dashboard page for admins. This route is nested under the `/` route with an `AdminLayout`.
-   `/admin/login` - The login page for admins.
-   `/book-appointment` - The page where users can book appointments.
-   `*` - The catch-all route that displays a "Not Found" page if no other routes match.

## Admin Credentials for login in the Booking App and managing events.

For testing the admin functionalities locally, you can use the following credentials:

-   Email: `admin@example.com`
-   Password: `password`
